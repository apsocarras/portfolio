        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p>Like many students, my path to a technical bootcamp was rather circuitous. 
        After graduating from the University of Virginia in 2019 with degrees in Philosophy and Middle Eastern Studies (Arabic), 
        I worked at a Medical NGO in D.C. that provided aid to Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). 
        I initially joined the Advocacy team as a translator but quickly transitioned to the research team, which had a longstanding need for someone who could 
        help coordinate research projects and manage the large amounts of data being collected in our field offices.</p>
        <p>As Research and Data Coordinator I taught myself data analysis and visualization using R and Python and managed PowerBI dashboards interfacing with our remote MySQL database.
        My growing interest in mathematics and statistics led me to leave my position to study full-time in preparation for a Biostatistics PhD, continuing to assist with the data analysis component 
        of some research projects at the organization.

        </p>
        <p>Despite having great success in my coursework, I decided the academic route was not for me. I joined the data engineering program at Data Stack Academy in order to accelerate my 
        skillbase and enter the industry as quickly as possible.
