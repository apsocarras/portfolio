# _My Portfolio_

#### By _**Alejandro Socarras**_

#### _A basic site for housing my coding portfolio_

## GitHub Pages

apsocarras.github.io/portfolio/

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS 
* Bootstrap

## Description

_The site showcases projects I have worked on during the first week of *Intro to Programming* at Epicodus, in addition to information about my background and interests. The page is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, but as I enter into my job search I will host the site on my own server and replace the projects here with those I'll have completed at Data Stack Academy._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_To run the project from your local system:_

1. Make a directory on your disk where you would like to clone the repo.

2. Copy the repo link: https://github.com/apsocarras/portfolio.git (available if you click the green "Code" dropdown button on this page).

3. Open your terminal and change into the directory you made (`cd /path/to/new/directory`).

4. Type `git clone ` and paste the URL.

5. Copy and paste the path to `index.html` into your browser's URL bar to open the page.

## Known Bugs

_On narrow screen widths, the "Dream Vacation" card on the homepage is not as wide as the other project cards._
